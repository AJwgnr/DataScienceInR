# Project title
Analysis of trajectory data of human movement in an virtual environment with relation to short and long term memory experiments.


# Overview
This project aims to study and analyze a dataset using R and to interactively visualize the results to allow scientist to explore the dataset on their own.
The dataset used in this project contains experimental test data from studies about human learning and explorative behavior of humans.
Within this project various statistical techniques such as clustering and classification, regression and correlation analysis, decision trees and other have to be freely tested on the dataset to retrieve new information and to gain insight.


# Team
The team consists of two master students, namely:

1. Johannes Dammbacher (206495)
2. Alexander Wagner (217884)

# Repository 
GitLab Repository: https://gitlab.com/vornamenachname/datascience_r.git

# Background and motivation

The data was recorded during a study on the impact of exploring novelty onto the learning success of children. Another constraint was the distinction between children with ADHD and children without.
For the experiment both children with ADHD and the control group had to attend the study on three different days.
On the first day the test persons got familiarized with the virtual world by spending between 10 and 20 min exploring of three worlds (see one of the worlds in the image below).
On day two the test persons had to learn 20 new vocabularies and recall them afterwards. After the recalling the test persons virtually explored another world for 10 to 20 min. The virtual worlds on day one and two were the same for some test persons and different for others. On day three simply the variables had to be recalled by the test persons (see the process overview in the image below).

Further test persons will perform the experiment in the future and thus enlarge the dataset iteratively.

## Dataset

The overall recorded data set consists of the trajectory data of the 66 test persons as well as several other variables such as sex, age and others. The dataset is divided into trajectory data and information about the test persons.
The trajectory data was retrieved by tracking the test persons movement within a 3D virtual Minecraft world. The sample rate was set to a tenth of a second. The data contains a time stamp and the x,y and z coordinate of the test persons avatar in the virtual world at a given time. Due to the software based digital tracking within a virtual world the sample points contain an exact time stamp and neither noise, nor outlier nor ambiguities or other measurement based bias.
The time spent in the virtual world should range from 10 to 20 minutes where the test persons could freely stop exploring the world after 10 minutes.
The dataset of the test persons contains variables such as sex, age and others as well as the number of words remembered correctly/wrongly on the first/second day, the virtual world id for day one/two and several scores obtained using a questionnaire related to immersion, exploration behavior and similar. The full list of attributes of the used datasets are listed below.

**Summary:**

* one csv file containing the information of the test persons (XX persons)
* 130 csv files containing the trajectory information (each person has two trajectory files)

# Objectives 

* Einfluss des Neugierverhalten auf die Erkundung der Welt
* Einfluss der Erkundung der Welt auf das Lernen (schwacher Reiz -> starker Reiz)
* Interactive visualization of the data set
* Predicting the ADHD type on basis of the trajectory data

* Impact of the novelty of the virtual world on day two on the learning success
* Impact of **novelty** and **exploitative excitability** score on the learning success
* Comparison/cluster analysis of the exploratory behavior of ADHD and control group
* Impact of the novelty seeking and exploitative excitability on the trajectory/exploration behavior



# Possible problems:

* Only a small dataset yet (can be hard to proof statistical significance)
* Some trajectory datasets can not be used completely because there was an error in the recording process or the test person stopped exploring the world earlier than expected
* Little comparable work on the feature extraction from trajectories
* Little comparable work on the comparison of trajectories


# Design overview (algorithms and methods you plan to use)
The project will consist of the following steps:

1. Data loading:
2. Data preprocessing:
3. Feature extraction:

4. Data analysis:
5. Visualization:






* Extract features from the trajectory data (Which features can be used?):
  + time spent per room (determine longest and shortest stay per room and scale them from 0 to 1)
  + time spent inside or outside house (???)
  + overall time spent in the world
  + repeated visit of same the place/room



* Clustering algorithm
* Clustering into exploitative behavior 
* Scatterplot Matrix, Correlation analysis
* Spectral analysis of trajectory data (if not to complicated)
* 3D Scatter Plot (for Trajectories)
* Regression Models
* Cluster visualisation
