# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview
This markdown document is the result of the semester project of the course Data Science with R held in the winter semester 2018/2019 at the computer science faculty at the Otto-von-Guericke university Magdeburg by M.Sc. Uli Niemann from the KMD Lab. Further details regarding the lecture can be found on the official course website. This project was done as a team consisting of the members Johannes Dambacher and Alexander Wagner. The general project idea as well as an detailed time plan can be found in the project proposal. The basic idea of the course was to choose a dataset and to to gain new insights using the language R. We have decided to use a dataset from the Universitätsklinik für Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie und Psychosomatische Medizin des Kindes- und Jugendalters (KKJP) at the medical faculty of the university of Magdeburg. Further information regarding the process how the dataset was generated can be found in the dataset section. For an interactive visualization please see our Shiny website !!!LINK!!!. The whole code for this project is stored in an public GitLab Repository.

## 1.3 Background and motivation
The data was recorded during a study on the impact of exploring novelty onto the learning success of children. The study group consisted of children having different types of ADHD and an control group.
For the experiment both groups (with ADHD and the control group) had to attend the study on three different days.
On the first day, the test persons got familiarized with the virtual world by spending between 10 and 20 minutes exploring one of the two worlds (see one of the worlds in the image below).
On the second day the test persons had to learn 20 new vocabularies and recall them afterwards. After the recalling the test persons had again the task to explore a virtual world for 10 to 20 minutes. The virtual world on day one and day two were the same for some test persons and different for others. On day three the vocabularies had to be recalled again by the test persons (see the process overview in the image below). Further test persons will perform the experiment in the future and thus enlarge the data set successively.

## 1.4 Dataset
The overall recorded data set consists of the trajectory data of 66 test persons in the virtual world as well as several other variables such as sex, age and others. The data set is divided into trajectory data and information of the test persons in separate csv files.
The trajectory data was retrieved by tracking the test persons movement within a 3D virtual Minecraft world. The sample rate was set to a tenth of a second. The data contains a time stamp and the x,y and z coordinate of the test persons avatar in the virtual world at a given time. Due to the software based digital tracking within a virtual world the sample points contain an exact time stamp and neither noise, nor outlier nor ambiguities or other measurement based bias.
The time spent in the virtual world should range from 10 to 20 minutes where the test persons could freely stop exploring the world after 10 minutes.
The data set of the test persons contains variables such as sex, age and others as well as the number of words remembered correctly/wrongly on the first/second day, the virtual world id for day one/two and several scores obtained using a questionnaire related to immersion, exploration behavior and similar. The full list of attributes of the used data sets are listed below.

**Summary:**

* one csv file containing the information of the test persons (66 persons)
* 130 csv files containing the trajectory information (for each person two trajectory files exist)
* **Attributes** and **features** refer to different things
* Attributes describe the test persons values such as age, sex and the scores determined using questionnaires
* Features describe the scalar representation of the trajectories computed from the trajectories using descriptor functions

### 1.4.2 Trajectory Table

There should be two trajectory files for each person. One for each day of exploration. The worlds explored can be the same or different between both days.
The logging step size was 10 fps the resulting trajectory files contain around 7000 entries. The cartesian coordinates are given in double precision.
Following the data structure of the trajectory files provided.

# 2. Concept

The following chapter contains the summarized general project plan that was written down in the project proposal in the beginning of the project. The description of the real implementation and the result can be found in section 3.

## 2.1 Objectives

We are trying to explore and answer the following questions:

* Which features can be created from the trajectory data?
* Can test persons not having ADHD memorize words better than persons having ADHD?
* What is the impact of the novelty of the virtual world on the learning success on day two (How did the number of remembered words change depending whether the test persons have seen an old or a new world before memorizing the vocabularies? Is there a difference for ADHD and non-ADHD persons?)
* What is the impact of the **novelty** and the **exploitative excitability** scores (On the learning success? On the exploration of the virtual world (e.g. duration)? On the trajectory?)
* Can the ADHD type be predicted from the trajectory data (features)?
* Which interactive visualization can be created for the data set?

## 2.2 Relevant Literature

* https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f73d/a038fe121e56fca15cadceea35398ba95063.pdf
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1585.pdf
* http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV137Wang.pdf


## 2.3 Possible problems
* Only a small data set yet (can be hard to proof statistical significance)
* Some trajectory data sets can not be used completely because there was an error in the recording process or the test person stopped exploring the world earlier than expected
* Little comparable work on the feature extraction from trajectories
* Little comparable work on the comparison of trajectories


## 2.4 Design overview
The design consists mainly of two parts:

1. Data analysis and
2. Interactive visualization

For the first part we will make use of algorithms and packages specialized for trajectory data, clustering and correlation analysis as well as regression fitting.
An important role is the extraction of features from the trajectory data. Since there is not much related work available, this task contains defining, testing and implementing possible features such as:

* Time spent per room
* Time spent inside or outside house
* Overall time spent in the world
* Repeated visit of same the place/room
* Steadiness vs roughness of motion
* Spectral features derived using fast Fourier transform

For the feature description the trajectory data (given in euclidian coordinates) has to be converted to a graph like representation that is listing the order and time spent in the rooms of the virtual world.
After the derivation of the trajectory features those will be used to predict or correlate to the test persons attributes retrieved by questionnaires. This tasks makes particular use of clustering algorithms.

The goal of the visual design is the interactive visualization of the data set itself and the analysis results of the data set.
To complete this task we will make use of the shiny library as much as possible with respect to the analysis of trajectory data.
The trajectory data will be visualized using 3D scatter plots. We will provide a visual comparison method of several trajectories from different test persons. We seek an embedding of the architecture of the virtual world into the scatter plot visualization.
The retrieved trajectory features will be represented in table form together with the test persons attributes to provide an detailed overview.
The table data will be displayed separately using a scatter plot matrix to allow analysis of correspondence and variance of the data. The scatter plot matrix will provide filter for splitting the data into groups (e.g. only test persons with ADHD).



# 3. Implementation
The ideas and results of the concept implementation will be de detailed in the following chapter.

## 3.1. Packages
We use the following R packages for the implementation:

* **shiny**
* pracma
* tibble
* **shinydashboard**
* **shinyWidgets**
* **data.table**
* ggplot2
* **plotly**
* dtplyr
* readxl
* stringr
* DT
* crosstalk
* GGally
* reader
* plyr
* **trajr**

The packages are listed in the order they are loaded.
We won´t go into detail about every package since there is a lot of information available on all of them online.
To mention are shiny and the various extensions used to create the interactive environment. The data.table package is an extension to the inbuild data.frame but can handle large data sets faster, reads data faster and provides an easier way of indexing and subsetting data.tabels.
We highlighted the plotly package not only because it provides an easy way to create interactive plots but also we prefered it over ggplot2 which we used only in special cases.
Probably the most unknown important package in this list is trajr. It is originally designd to analyse 2d animal trajectories. Although our data contains 3d trajectory data the trajr package has proved usefull in feature computation.
The packages not mentioned here are used for minor computations throughout the program and could be replaced with similar packages in most cases.

## 3.2 Data
As already written in the concept section, the dataset consists of two kinds of files. The person data and the trajectory data. The person data contains information about the test persons and has several NAN´s or missing values. Furthermore it has a column which indicates that the corresponding trajectory file is maybe not complete. The section 3.1.1 discuss how we load and store the data while section 3.1.2 describes how we deal with the missing values.
- Data loading and computation is done seperatly from data
- New data and even attributes can be added easily
- Trajectory feature computation works independed of data (can be used for animal studies etc. as well as long as the same data structrues are used)

### 3.2.1 Data preprocessing
- remove entries with NAN´s
- rmeove entries with missing values
- remove persons
- remove trajectory files
- rename files
- create room coordinate files

### 3.2.2 Data structure and loading

The test persons data table described in 1.4.1 is the first data loaded into a data.table object using the fread function of the belonging package. The data table contains all the attributes listed in 1.4.1. Those attributes and column names remain unchanged throughout the program. The persons data table is the most crucial part of data and used for various plots and analysis tasks.

The second data loaded into are the trajectory files stored in csv format. Since they the trajectory files contain a different number of rows each and are based on several virtual minecraft worlds they are loaded and stored into two lists. One for each day indexed by the persons VP number. There is no separation made between the different virtual worlds at this step. The trajectories themselves are stored as data.table using fread to gain a significant speed up compared to the inbuilt loading function and storage into data.frame.

The last data loaded from file by default are two files containing the geometry of the virtual worlds. There are three worlds but only differ geometrically where as world one and three only differ in color and appearance.
The files contain the following attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|:-----------:|----------------------------------------------|
| z         |z coordinate minecraft world (cartesian, floor level)   |
| x1        |lower x coordinate minecraft world (cartesian) |
| x2        |upper x coordinate minecraft world (cartesian) |
| y1        |lower y coordinate minecraft world (cartesian) |
| y2        |upper y coordinate minecraft world (cartesian) |
| id        |room identification number (integer,[-1,#rooms])|
|name       |room name (char) |
|RoomType   |room type: inside/closed, outside/open, stairway/level change (integer,[0,1,2])|

Since the geometry of world one and three is equal the number of rooms is equal as well. For the worlds one and two this does not hold.
The geometry only allows for rectangular rooms consisting of the lower vertex (x1,y1) and the upper vertex (x2,y2) spanning the rectangle and holding x1<x2 and y1<y2. This is checked and corrected within the loading function. The rooms contain only the lower z coordinate which is sufficient for both plotting of the rooms and converting the trajectory data to a room based graph. The rooms must be sorted by increasing z externally to work correctly. This cannot be done at loading time to allow the description of complex geometry such as round stairways with the simple model of rectangles.
The id and name of the room both identify the room but can occur multiple time in the geometry file to form non rectangular rooms. The id counts all the rooms from zero to #rooms and contains minus one as special id reserved as entry for trajectory coordinates outside all room coordinates.
The room type specifies the appearance of the room within the world. For outside regions such as gardens it is difficult to divide the area into regions similar to rooms. The borders are rather soft and the entry or leaving of one region is not comparable to entering a room through a door. Another special case are stairways which are not always rooms on their own but also probably noteworthy. To allow the analysis in respect to the various room types this column has been added but not found much use in the current program due to a lack of time to implement the necessary filters.

With all the external data loaded further crucial data can be derived.
These include the computation of a room based graph from cartesian trajectories, a histogram like summary of the room based graph data, the conversion to trajr object to derive trajr features such as straightness and the computation of several internal used summary statistics.

The data.table roomGraphData and roomHistData are computed for each test person from the specific trajectory file and are stored similar to the trajectory data in lists, one for each day. Following their structure:

# RoomGrahData table

| Attribute | Description |
|:-----------:|----------------------------------------------|
| Room        | room identification number from geometry (integer,[-1,#rooms])                        |
| TimeSpent   | time spent at this visit within the room (decisecond)        |
| RoomType    | room type from geometry (integer,[0,1,2]) |
| name        |room name (char) from geometry   |

# RoomHistData table

| Attribute | Description |
|:-----------:|----------------------------------------------|
| ID          | room identification number from geometry (integer,[-1 to #rooms])                        |
| Entries     | number       |
| TimeSpent   | room type from geometry (integer,[0,1,2]) |
| Name        | room name (char) from geometry   |

The conversion from cartesian trajectory files to room graph based description is done for each trajectory file using the corresponding room geometry file.
During the conversion the room geometry file is iterated for each trajectory file and the corresponding room id is stored for each trajectory entry. Since the room geometry is sorted by z only the highest room survives after iterating all rooms.
The resulting room graph contains a list of all rooms visited in the order of visit. Since rooms can be reentered multiple times the room graph may contain more entries than there are rooms. Similar to the trajectory files the number of entries most likely differs between different test persons or days of experiment.
For entry the time spent at that specific visit is stored along the room id and name.

The room history data.table is similar to the room graph data.table but summarizes information in a histogram like manner per room. Thus the length of the room hist is equal to the number of rooms in the specific world and the same for different test persons (as long as they visited the same world).
For each room the total time spent within the room, the total number of entries into the room, id and name. It is possible to store the average time spent in the rooms per visit along side but this is not implemented.

Both the room graph and room history are stored in two lists each similar to the trajectory files.

Because the computation, especially the conversion from trajectory to room graph description takes a lot of time. Therefore the files are both stored in /precomputed as


To work with the trajr package the trajectory files have to be converesed to a trajr object using the TrajFromCoords function provided by trajr.
The conversion results in the following data structure:

| Attribute | Description |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------|
|x                | x-coordinate (cartesian)|
|y                | y-coordinate (cartesian)|
|time             | time in decisecond starting at 0|
|displacementTime | here same as time|
|polar            | polar coordinates (complex)|
|displacement     | displacement vector between consecutive points (complex)|

## 3.3 Algorithms and Methods

### 3.3.1 Machine Learning
- Linear Regression
- Clustering

### 3.3.2 Visualization
- bar charts
- Tables
- Scatterplot
- 3D-Plots + Rooms (trajectory plots)
- Boxplots


## 3.4 Tests
We tested the functionality of our application manually. We checked the visualizations of the trajectory plots of every test person on every day. Furthermore we also checked all the other charts on a Linux and on windows systems using different browsers.
With respect to the usability we found that some parts of our Shiny web application are not repsonsive in every browser. But this is only limited to some layouting problems.
Having a look at the performance of our app we can see that there are possibilities for improvement. The first time loading the webpage and preprocessing of the data takes around one minute. Using the precomputed data we can get the loading time below 15 seconds.



# 4. Results

The results of our analysis can be viewed in our interactive Shiny web application which is hosted here (INSERT LINK).The following plots are screenshots captured from the webpage.

The webpage is divided into six (MAYBE C_HANGE THIS) parts. The first two parts provide an introduction to this project and videos showing the different virtual world´s ("Project Introduction" and "The Experiment" tab on the website"). Those topics have already been covered in this markdown file and will not be further discussed here.

## 4.1 The Dataset
The dataset tab on the website covers the basic interaction and visualization with the raw dataset. It is showing the basic statistics of the dataset and allows the exploration of the data table containing the data of the test persons (See the image below).

![Raw view on the dataset](../proposal/images/Rawdata table.png)


There are different possibilities for the user to analyse the dataset. The data can just be viewed as displayed in the image above but the correlation tab allows to choose any two variables from the data and to plot the may existing linear relationship.(image below)


![Linear correlation of attributes](../proposal/images/regression.png)


It is the task of the user to choose meaningful attributes. Nevertheless we found that the following variable combinations yield some linear correlation (see next XX images):
INSERT IMAGES OF CORRELATED VARIABles HERE


Besides the option of plotting only two dependent variables, the webpage also offers the option to create a scatterplot of as many attributes as desired (See the next image). A short drawback is the problem that Shiny is not capable of rendering huge axis labels correctly which can may disturb the analysis when many features are used.

![Scatterplot matrix of person data attributes](../proposal/images/scatterplotmatrix.png)


When an entry from the raw dataset tab is choosen by the user the two availiable trajectory files are plotted using a 3D plot in the trajectory tab (in the image below). Furthermore there is a blue input that can be used to adjust which part of the trajectory is plotted (e.g. only plot the first 50 percent of the time spent in the world). The input also allows to print the "rooms" of the virtual world into the plot and to decide which z-intervall is being plotted (e.g. to plot only the first floor of the buildings in the virtual world).


![Trajectorie visualization](../proposal/images/trajectoryand roomdata.png)


Besides the raw trajectory data the "Time per room" and "Rooms entered" tabs allow to view more detailed information about the time the test persons spent in the virtual world. The "Time per room" tab shows the information about how much time in seconds was spent in the rooms in the world. For doing this we created an additional dataset that maps the rooms in the world to the trajectory coordinates. The "Rooms entered" tab visualizes how often a room was entered. Both graphics are plotted using bar charts. We use this information later on to build features for the trajectories.

![Memorizing experiment group distribution](../proposal/images/rooms.png)

## 4.2 Memorizing Experiment
The following charts are dealing with the analyzation of the results of the memorizing experiment. On top of the website tab the most important figures of the experiment are shown:

* Testpersons had to recall 20 vocabularies
* Average direct recall was: 11.5 words
* Average delayed recall was: 8.7 words

* Group 1: Test persons having only seen the same world twice: 39.68  %
* Group 2: Test persons having seen a new world on the second day: 41.27 %
* Group 3: Test persons having seen a partial new world on the second day: 19.05 %

Furthermore the bar charts below those figures show the distribution of the ADHD type of the test person with respect to the three different groups.

IMPORTANT INSIGHTS:
- Less people in partial new group -> also only control group there
- less ADHD test persons than persons in control group


![Memorizing experiment group distribution](../proposal/images/memorizing.png)

The following four boxplots show the comparison of the average TP_Direct_Recall and the TP_Delayed_Recall with respect to the ADHD and control group test persons.

* Group 1: Test persons having only seen the same world twice
* Group 2: Test persons having seen a new world on the second day
* Group 3: Test persons having seen a partial new world on the second day
* Group 4: Overall summary

IMPORTANT INSIGHTS:
- Non ADHD persons can memorize words better
- there are ADHD persons in the partial new world yet

## 4.3 Trajectory Features



# 5. Conclusions

Recapitulating this whole project, we followed the steps of an general data science project. At first we analyzed the data we got, thought about algorithms that can be applied, cleaned and preprocessed the data, calculated features, created visualizations and finally an interactive shiny web application that offers experts the ability to analyze the data.

While implementing the application, we separated the visualizations from the underlying data such that new data can be added easily and no component in the web application needs to be changed. By seperating the loading of the data, preprocessing and feature computation into several .R files that are sourced from the webpage we also allow to reuse those files independently of the webpage. This not only allows to continue developing the further analysis of the data without a shiny webpage but also to apply our function to completely new data (like other trajectories).

Overall our web application lacks
- not that many machien learning algortihms, no classification etc.
- trajectory feature computation was complicated.
- not statistical tests


# 5.1 R Feedback

In the following section we describe our experiences with the R programming language and the Shiny package.

**Advantages**:

* Allows to prototype very fast
* Offers many packages that can be used
* Nice visualizations can be created easily

**Disadvantages**:

* Steep learning curve
* Not very clear how to structure R projects or especially Shiny projects (more than 2500 lines of code in our project)
* Error messages are really bad because they are in the final rendered html and not in the real R code
* Shiny Dashboard is not responsive
* Problems when using different Shiny, R or package versions


# 5.2 Final Insights
- summarize the most important insights about the dataset here!



# 5.3 Future Work

For the further development of this project, we identified the three following tasks:

* Include more data of test persons
* Use statistical tests
* Apply classification techniqeus to trajectory features to try to separate ADHD and non-ADHD test persons


# 6 Course Feedback

Since it is the first time this course was offered, we thought about several things that can be improved for the next course:

* Period for the project was far too short (after the proposal review meeting there were only 8 weeks with 2 weeks christmas holiday in between)
* No really clear requirements for the final project result (maybe offer an example of how a final project should look like)
* Setup a fixed appointment after half of the project time (students can get feedback if they are working in the right direction)
* Screencast of the application doesn´t really make sense
